			<strong>Origin of Oracle Bones Inscriptions</strong></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>1. Background</strong></p>
		<p>
			Regarding about the origin of Chinese characters, currently there are two types of models can be summerized in scholars:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Creation Model<br />
				Such model is based upon the legends or some historic records --&nbsp; that characters were invented, for example, by Yu, CiangJie etc.<sup>[<a href="#Ciangjie">Ciangjie</a>]</sup> However, such kind of&nbsp;statement lacks scientific evidences and could not be verified.</li>
			<li>
				Evolution Model<br />
				Such model proposed that Chinese characters were gradually developed from a low level of some painting/drawing/symbols to high level intelligent writing system thru natural selection. Such model can well explain how some of pictograms could assembly to the objects we observed; but it also has many other issues that we could not explain; its archeological evidences are also flimsy.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Based on our TBI study, this paper provides a third one called revelation model.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Revelation Model</strong></p>
		<p>
			While the evolution model could be well applied into Egypt hieroglyphics or Maya iconic writing development system, since we have found large mount of painting/drawing that could match the characters in writing system, although it was still arguable.<br />
			<br />
			But, it seems obvious that the evolution model does not fit into Chinese writing system. Because, so far, from large amount of unearth materials at Anyang, we could not find any painting/drawings, or any other symbols that could be related to the earlier stage of characters that could directly link to characters in writing system. The Chinese writing system, once appeared in history, were extremely matured and advanced. Such fact, along with our character analysis results, led us to propose a revelation model -- that Chinese writing system were revealed by what they originally worshiped through multiple medias, not only the objects they saw in daily life on earth, but also including their remote and ancestor&#39;s rich inherited oral legends, as well as their believes from heaven. Such complicated but consistent writing system had simple but in subconscious purpose -- to antedate the expected hope of story about the cross -- the way that could help to escape the unresistant falling. The inspiration medias that we can find so far can be discussed as following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Turtle</strong><br />
				<br />
				As compared with many other animals, like lion or tiger, turtle was small, ugly, dirty and disgusting. However, if we look into its shell, we can find that the turtle shell has two unique features that any other bones in the world does not have. The first, its plastron possess clear visible schism pattern which can perfectly match oracle bones inscription&#39;s character pattern. If we compare such schism pattern with OBI, we can find that many fundamental root characters, like the cross, sheep, son etc can perfect match to the plastron schism pattern[table]. This schism pattern also contains the object-oriented concepts. This unique feature related to characters&nbsp;suggested that turtle could be one of medias to contribute to the invention of Chinese writing system. (see table: <a href="./_1100___Turtle_schism_and_character.htm">Turtle Plastron Schism and Chinese Characters</a>)<br />
				<br />
				The second, the turtle shell, both plastron and carapace, had naturally inscribed various fearful mysterious colorful drawing pattern. If we compare such pattern with the totem on bronzes and many other artistic works, we can found that they assembly to each others.(see table: <a href="./_1100___Turtle_and_Totem.htm">Turtle and Totem</a>)<br />
				<br />
				The totem was the symbol of divine in China. Similarly, we can find that Chinese characters were treated as same divine as totem at Shang times. This could explain the the facts that earliest Chinese writing scriptures only appeared on turtle bones, as well as on bronzes, both of them were the center of sacred rituals.<br />
				<br />
				Due to the feature of divinity of characters, we could find that the usage of characters were strictly limited. The knowledge of characters were also strictly protected. The emperors&#39; name were carefully picked up. No all people could have their name using characters. Not all people could use it at anywhere else. This could explain why we have found the plant leaves,<sup>[<a href="#WangShuzhi">Wang</a>]</sup> but could not find bamboo inscriptions, silk scriptures, stone inscriptions, or any other types of books using such matured and advanced writing system at or before Shang dynasty. The character Shu in OBI was not the regular book we thought for today, but the book about the story of good news that they expected for thier future.<br />
				<br />
				The strict limited usage on area of worship rituals only could also demonstrated that the original invention and usage of characters were the results of driven forces -- at one hand the civilization was highly developed at the edge of explosion, on the other hand, at the same time, the society was full of serious crisis with uncertainty, upset, desperation and threatening in the edge of broken.<br />
				<br />
				The bronzes in ancient time could be used to represent the all-mighty, judgment, righteousness, uninvadableness from god. The character appeared on bronzes could further demonstrate divinity features. But the characters appeared on little ugly turtle bones were very special at ancient time in the world -- it could only tell us how the role it ever played during the invention of sacred characters.<br />
				<br />
				It was only in Chinese history that the turtle was unreasonably treated as mysterious and sometimes idolatry or superstitious symbolic<sup>[<a href="#Liji-LiYun">LiJi_LiYun</a>]</sup> and could be traced over all lands in China and in all dynasties.<sup>[<a href="#_FanFangfang">FanFangfang</a>]</sup> The sculpture of turtles can still be found in many relics site today. For example, the stone turtle carryings a stone stele on its back was very common in many temples in China today; the others are like, the stone turtle in temple of heaven built during 1406 to 1420 in Beijing, the turtle seals found in WaWangDui tomb (West Han 206-BC) and so on. (see table: <a href="./_1100___Turtle_in_China.htm">Turtles in China</a>)<br />
				<br />
				Today people consider words of turtle as shameful and insulting languages in China. They totally forgot its fundamental roles ever played as the cradle of Chinese writing system as well as the origin of totem in art in Chinese culture. It should be the turtle, not dragon, considered as Chinese national emblem.</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>Constellation</strong><br />
				<br />
				If we look at the contents of earliest sentences, we can find they were used with accurate and strict of days and months information -- an advanced and mature calendar system. As we know that calendar system and astronomy are undividable. This further led us to discover the close relationship between the characters and the constellation -- many fundamental character shape can match the stars pattern on the sky. Such connections suggested that earliest characters were simplified directly from complicated real object image drawing/painting through visual thinking and comparison of constellation -- a character can be instantly directly created with similarity of real of object without the process of painting/drawing with art and techniques. Some of character was likely to be picked up from sky directly, like the &#39;Northern Cross&#39; for today. No evolution process was needed at all.<br />
				<br />
				In order to show how easily the TBI could be identified or created from sky, we choose the modern OSI and some hundreds years old chinese constellations charts as examples. We can find that Orion is similar to &#39;cross&#39;, Gemini Twin to Chong, Draco and Ursa Minor to animal body, Cygnus to Lai (come), dipper to Ji, etc. (see table: <a href="./_1100___Constellation_and_Character.htm">Constellations and Characters</a>)&nbsp; On the other hands, the small circles, dot lines and arrows among OBI reflected the fetures of collstation charts.<br />
				<br />
				However, constellation is the visual thinking pictures of stars. So different believes will produce different constellation charts. One of the biggest challenges for this theory is that we could not find any original constellation chart at Anyang site. But the matured and advanced calendar showed that they knew astronomy very well.<br />
				<br />
				Inspired from constellation, and used back for the calendar system, it was inside of the same internal process of writing system invention process. Heaven (天) and god (神) are exchangeable in meaning and usage in Chinese literature and philosophy concepts. The term astronomy itself in Chinese (天文TianWen) means &#39;heaven&#39; and &#39;language&#39; (天Tian: heaven, 文Wen: language, writing, scripts, character, culture etc.) -- the heaven and Chinese writing system are undividable.<sup>[<a href="#HuangDiNeiJin">HuangDi</a>]</sup><br />
				<br />
				Such theory could explain why the most animal pictograms, like dog, horse, pig etc, in TBI that was written in vertical way headed to upside rather than in horizontal way. It was implying that they came from heaven. There exist large mount of rotated symmetric characters, like Hua, etc. since it is the polar star centered constellation movement. Recently, some scholars began to explore this areas about Chinese ancient astronomy. <sup>[FengShi]</sup> It has shown us that ancient sages know more than what we do about the astronomy for today.&nbsp;</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>Hieroglyphics</strong><br />
				<br />
				Since the discovery of silk road, more and more evidences have been found to indicate that the message exchange between east and west were already exist at Shang dynasty.<sup>[<a href="#silkroad">silkroad</a>]</sup>&nbsp; According to the archeological report in Anyang in 2000, among large mount of buried skulls in royal tombs, some of them belong to Europe Caucasians race.<sup>[<a href="#AnyangLiji">AngyangLiji</a>]</sup><br />
				<br />
				In our obi study, we also found that there exists large mount of similarities between hieroglyphics and Chinese characters, not only on the symbols, patterns of combination words, but also on the worship, believes, as well as its kernel symbol of &#39;cross&#39; which can be deducted as subconscious antedating as Chinese characters. (see table: <a href="./_1100___Hieroglyphics_and_TBI.htm">Comparison Between TBI and Hieroglyphics</a>) Such similarities could be considered as another evidence of culture exchanges between west and east at ancient times.<br />
				<br />
				On the other hand, the similarities existed between Chinese and hieroglyphics suggest that Chinese characters invention were more or less influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphics and its culture. This could explain why there were no painting/drawing as early stage of writing existed. Since the early practice developing stages were already finished during hieroglyphics times for the inventors.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In summary, using the revelation model to create a root character, it need to meet at least three conditions at the same time:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				assembly to real object in image on earth.</li>
			<li>
				match constellation in shape in heaven.</li>
			<li>
				predict the upcoming events in some ways related to the story about the &#39;cross&#39; around at 1 AD.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These conditions defined the properties of characters with uniqueness, divinity and unchangeable, where the powerful life of character it came from, and how they could distinguish themselves to other fake characters, like the simulated oracle characters created for 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.<sup>[<a href="#Sample">2008Beijing</a>]</sup> The essential differences between OBI and Hieroglyphics came from the onstellation match.</p>
		<p>
			Chinese characters are the only pictograms languages in the world that is still in use for today. Since created, within more than three thousands years, Chinese characters experienced many different dynasties, split, wars, expansion, foreign invasion and culture genocide, as well as all kinds of foreign religious impacts like Buddha or materialism etc; Chinese characters itself also experienced all kinds of operations, like the so-called unification, simplification and obsoleting and so on; the characters we used for today, the simplified or traditional, already look quite different from its original one in shape; Although we can still recognize its root of characters, along with the changes of shapes, Chinese people gradually lost many original meaning of each character; they lost the original purpose of usage of characters; they forgot ancestors who invented the characters; they forgot where the characters came from, how the characters were invented, when they were invented; they lost many technology associated with the characters like astronomy, calendars, metallics, medicines etc; they lost the original virtues, spirits as well as ancestor&#39;s believes. From this point, through thousands of years, we can see that Chinese characters were not evolved at all but rather had been undergoing a devolution process in long history.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>3. Conclusions</strong></p>
		<p>
			Among three models (creation, evolution and revelation), the revelation model can best scientifically expose the essence of origin of Chinese characters. It does not contradict to creation model but can provide rich archeological evidences and logical reasoning that creation model could not do. The evolution model seems most problematic to the origin of Chinese characters.</p>

These mummified remains may have been of people who spoke Indo-European languages, that remained in use in the Tarim Basin, in the modern day Xinjiang region, until replaced by Turkic influences from the northern Xiongnu Empire, and by Chinese influences from the eastern Han Dynasty, who spoke a Sino-Tibetan language.<br />
