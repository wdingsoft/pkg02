This is an excavation photograph of work on tomb #1001 at Anyang in the northern part of Henan province, China. The work was undertaken between the fall of 1934 and the spring of 1935 by the Academia Sinica, now located in Taiwan. Numerous tombs were dug up in this area, revealing substantial evidence of the late Shang dynasty  (ca. 1300–ca. 1050) period when the capital was located at Yin, near the modern town of Anyang.
