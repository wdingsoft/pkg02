<strong><h3 id="chapter-0"> ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PEOPLE </h3></strong><p></p><p class="mark"> <span class="right"><img src="ANCIENT-EGYPTIAN-PEOPLE-FESTIVALS-AND-MARRIAGE%20_%20Facts-and-Details_files/20120215-carrying%2520stuff.jpg" hight="264" alt="20120215-carrying stuff.jpg" title="20120215-carrying stuff.jpg" width="271"> <br> </span>
  The study of ancient Egyptian people and life---whether it be homes, 
food, family life, hair care, child rearing, pets or  whatever---is 
based mostly on identifying scenes associated with each of these 
activities from monuments, temples and tombs and translating and 
interpreting the inscriptions and texts found with them. Clues can also 
be gleaned from artifacts found in burials.

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-1"><strong> Population and Birth Control in Ancient Egypt</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  It is not known exactly what ancient Egyptians 
looked like: whether they were white, black or brown. Many scholars 
believe they probably looked like modern Egyptians.

</p><p class="mark">  At its height, ancient Egypt only had a population
 of 1.5 to 2 million people. Large cities in the Near East in the third 
millennium B.C. had only around 20,000 or 30,000 people.  The population
 density around Amarana---royal city built by Akhnaten to honor the god 
Atun---was  about 500 people per square mile in 1540 BC.

</p><p class="mark">  It is estimated that the population of Egypt (the 
Nile Valle)  doubled between 4000 and 3000 B.C.  and quadrupled between 
4000 B.C. and 2500 B.C., the height of the Old Kingdom, when the 
pyramids were built. In 1250 B.C. the population of ancient Egypt was 
about 1.5 times what it was in 2500 B.C. and then it dropped to Old 
Kingdom levels before the Greco-Roman period.

</p><p class="mark">  To keep from having babies, Egyptian women were 
advised to inset a mixture of honey and crocodile dung in their vagina. 
The honey may have acted as a temporary cervical cap but the most 
effective agent was acid in the dung that acted as the world's first 
spermicide.

</p><p class="mark">  Methods of birth control mentioned in the Petri 
Papyrus (1850 B.C.) and Eber Papyrus (1550 B.C.) included coitus 
interruptus and coitus obstructus (ejaculating into a bladder inserted 
in a depression at the base of urethra).

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-2"><strong> Holidays and Festivals in Ancient Egypt</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark"> <span class="left"><img src="ANCIENT-EGYPTIAN-PEOPLE-FESTIVALS-AND-MARRIAGE%20_%20Facts-and-Details_files/20120215-aler_der_Grabkammer_des_Antef.jpg" hight="198" alt="20120215-aler_der_Grabkammer_des_Antef.jpg" title="20120215-aler_der_Grabkammer_des_Antef.jpg" width="350"> <br> </span>
  The Egyptians invented the 24 hour day and helped pioneer the concept 
of time as an entity. They divided the day into two cycles of 12 hours 
each. The origin of the 12-hour division might come from star patterns 
in the sky or from the Sumerian number system which was based on the 
number 12.

</p><p class="mark">  The Babylonians are often given credit for 
devising the first calendars, and with them the first conception of time
 as an entity. They developed and used the 360-day year---divided into 
12 lunar months of 30 days (real lunar months are 29½ days)---devised by
 the Sumerians and introduced the seven day week, corresponding to the 
four waning and waxing periods of the lunar cycle. The ancients 
Egyptians adopted the 12-month system to their calendar. The ancient 
Hindus, Chinese, and Egyptians, all used 365-day calendars.

</p><p class="mark">  The Babylonians stuck stubbornly to the lunar 
calendar to define the year even though 12 lunar months did not equal 
one year. In 432 B.C., the Greeks introduced the so-called Metonic cycle
 in which every 19 years seven of the years had thirteen months and 12 
years had 12 months. These kept the seasons in synch with the year and 
the roughly kept the days and months of the Metonic year in synch with 
those on the lunar calendar. The Metonic calendar was too complicated 
for everyday use and used mostly by astronomers.

</p><p class="mark">  The Mesopotamians also invented the 60 minute 
hour. The idea of measuring the year was more important than measuring 
the day. People could judge the time of day by following the sun. 
Judging the time of year was more difficult and important in knowing 
when to plant crops, expect rain or snow and harvest crops. That is why a
 yearly calendar was developed before clocks and minutes and seconds 
didn’t come to the Middle Ages.

</p><p class="mark">  The Babylonians have been credited with coming up 
with the idea of dividing the hour into 60 minutes. The number 60 seemed
 to be prized especially since 360 divided by six is 60 and some 
scholars have speculated that is why hours are made up of 60 minutes and
 minutes are made up of 60 seconds. Other believe the number 60 was 
arrived at by multiplying the visible planets (5, Mercury, Venus, Mars, 
Jupiter, and Saturn) by the number of months (12).

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-3"><strong> Ancient Egyptian Calendar</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  Although Mesopotamians devised the first calenders the Egyptians conceived the modern 365-day, 12 month calendar.

</p><p class="mark">  Egyptians added five days to the Babylonian 
360-day calendar. The ancient Egyptian civil calendar had three season: 
1) Akhet (Flooding); 2) Peret (Growing or Sowing); and 3) Shemu 
(Harvest). Each season had four months with 30 days. The additional five
 days were tacked onto the end of Harvest and set aside for feasting 
during the annual flooding of the Nile. The Hindus and Chinese also used
 365-day calendars.

<p></p><p class="mark">  Egypt devised a 365-day calendar as early as 
the 5th millennium based on flood of the Nile which occurred at almost 
the same time every year. The Egyptian year began in July when the Nile 
usually flooded and was marked by the rising of the star Sirius in the 
eastern horizon just before daybreak.

</p><p class="mark">  The Egyptians discovered that not only did the 
star Sirius line up with the rising sun around the time of flooding 
every year they also noticed that Sirius lined up with sun about six 
hours (a ¼ a day) different every year.  They were among the first 
people to realize the need for a leap day. For a while they inserted a 
leap day into their calendar but then abandoned it. This meant their 
calendar would slip a day every four years and an entire month every 120
 years.

</p><p class="mark">  A trilingual description of changes to be made to 
the Egyptian calendar was found at the temple of Bubastis, the 8th 
century capital of Egypt.  The 2,200-year-old stellate described planned
 changes for the Egyptian calendar that were implemented d250 years 
later by Julius Caesar.

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-4"><strong> Ancient Egyptian Festivals</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  During ancient Egyptian festivals statues of 
the gods were carried by priests in a procession to other temples so 
they could visit with other gods. During a festival that celebrated the 
founding of the first Egyptian kingdom the pharaoh did a dance while 
wearing a short skirt with an animal tail hanging from behind it.

<p></p><p class="mark">  A "sexual union between the king and queen" was
 probably part of the Great fertility Festival of Min. During the 
Ptolemaic era an effigy of Osiris was sacrificed and then reborn with 
barley spraying from the top of the effigy like a sparklers from a Roman
 candle. ["World Religions" edited by Geoffrey Parrinder, Facts on File 
Publications, New York]

</p><p class="mark">  Annual animal cult festivals were big events. A.R 
Williams wrote in National Geographic, “Like country fairs, these great 
gatherings enlivened religious centers up and down the Nile. Pilgrims 
arrived by the hundreds of thousands and setup camp.  Music and dancing 
filled the processional rite.  Merchants sold food, drink and souvenirs.
 Priests became salesmen, offering wrapped mummies, as well as more 
elaborate ones for people who cold spend more---or thought they should. 
With incense swirling all around, the faithful ended their journey by 
delivering their chosen mummy to the temple with a prayer.”

</p><p class="mark">  The key annual event occurred in midsummer, and it
 involved not only the sun but also the bright star Sirius (which they 
equated with the astral god Sothis). Every spring Sirius disappears for 
several weeks , hidden by the sun’s glare. The New Year began when 
Sirius first became visible again in the predawn sky, heralding the 
flooding of the Nile.

<p></p><p class="mark">  The Apis bull was one of the most revered 
animals in all of ancient  Egypt. A.R. Williams wrote in National 
Geographic, “On the bull’s burial day, city residents surged into the 
streets to observe this occasion of national mourning. Wailing and 
tearing at their hair, they crowded the route at the catacomb now known 
as Serapeum in the desert necropolis of Saqqara. In a procession, priest
 temple, singers, and exalted officials delivered the mummy to the 
network of vaulted galleries carved into the bedrock of limestone. There
 among the long corridors of previous burials, they interred the mummy 
in a massive wooden or granite sarcophagus.” [Ibid]

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-5"><strong> Opet Festival</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  The Opet Festival in Thebes was held annually 
during the season of Nile flooding. It celebrated the annual reunion of 
the Thebean Triad: the great god Amum, his wife Mut and their son 
Khonsu. Details of the ceremony are carved in a relief in the 
processionary colonnade in Luxor Temple.

</p><p class="mark">  The ceremony may be been developed by Queen 
Hatshepsut. Opet means "southern sanctuary," a reference to Luxor 
Temple, the  southern temple in Thebes. The Opet Festival began on the 
nineteenth day of the second month of the flood (the end of August). 
Earlier versions of the festival lasted 11 days. By the 18th dynasty 
(1550-1298 B.C.) the festival was the main event on the Egyptian 
calendar. In Ramses II's time it continue for 27 days. The festival 
itself may have lasted into the Roman era.

</p><p>
</p><div class="center"><img src="ANCIENT-EGYPTIAN-PEOPLE-FESTIVALS-AND-MARRIAGE%20_%20Facts-and-Details_files/20120215-dancing.jpg" hight="264" alt="20120215-dancing.jpg" title="20120215-dancing.jpg" width="518"> <br> </div>

<p></p><p class="mark">  The focal point of the early version of the 
festival was a procession in which the statue of Amun-Re, carried by 30 
priests, and the statues of Mut and Kohonsu, were transported in boat 
shrines from the Temple of Karnak to the Temple of Luxor. The statues 
remained in the sanctuary of Luxor Temple for a couple of days before 
being carried back to Karnak on sacred boats.

</p><p class="mark">  Large crowds of people came out for processions. 
Merrymakers sang hymns, drank wine, anointed themselves with unguent and
 placed flowers on their heads.  Participants in the procession included
 the Pharaoh, royal charioteers, priests, incense burners, fan bearers, 
bureaucrats, soldiers, musicians, singers and dancers. Female acrobats 
performed to rhythm of castanets, drums and sistrum rattles and priests 
carried offerings such as cattle, gazelles, wine, fruit, bouquets and 
lotus flowers.  ♀

</p><p class="mark">  In a later version of the festival the pharaoh and
 the statues were carried to Luxor on ceremonial barges, which moved 
upstream with sails and tow lines pulled by men on the shore. At the end
 of the festival the barge was carried downstream by the current.

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-6"><strong> Rituals of the Opet Festival</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  The climatic rituals of the Opet Festival 
occurred in the Sacrarium of Amenophis III (next to the Courtyard of 
Amenophis III of Luxor Temple). The pharaoh followed his priests into 
the inner sanctums of Luxor temple where no one else was allowed to go 
and performed rites to renew the energy of the Pharaoh and the gods for 
another year.  Describing the rite for Ramses II Rick Gore wrote in 
National Geographic, "Wearing the solar crown with solar disks, ram's 
horns and cobras---symbols of divine rule---Ramses offers flowers and 
incense, dropping an aromatic pellet into a burner...Arum returns fumes,
 thereby renewing Ramses's own divinity."♣


</p><p class="mark">  The ritual offering of flowers, associated with 
regeneration, intensified during the feast, and people  presented them 
in holders shaped like anks. Festival attendees scraped dust from the 
temples for healing and devotion, a practice that still remains today.  
Egyptologist Salima Ikram of Cairo’s American University  told U.S. News
 and World Report, “Men drink their temple scrapings in tea to become 
more potent---early Viagra!--- and said that women circle ths stone 
scarab near Karnak’s sacred lake seven times as a fertility ritual

</p><p class="mark">  Haggag el Uqsuri in Luxor is a modern <em>  moulid </em>
  (festival) that honor’s Luxor’s patron saint, Abu el Haggag, a 12th 
century Sufi mystic. It is believed to be based on the ancient Egyptian 
Opet Festival.

  The custom of handshaking has been traced back to ancient Egypt. 
Hieroglyphics, dating back to 2800 B.C., representing the verb "to 
give," show an extended hand. Kings in ancient Babylon and Assyria 
grasped the hands of statues of their major Gods during important 
celebrations and festivals.

</p><p class="mark">  The first known book of manners and correct manners, <em>  The Instructions of Ptahhotep </em>
 , was written around 2500 B.C. and a papyrus copy lies a Museum. Known 
as the "Prisse payrus," it advises guests with their boss to "laugh when
 he laughs," and "thou shalt be agreeable to his heart." Women are 
advised to "Be silent it is a better gift than flowers.”

</p><p class="mark">  In Genesis 41:41-42 a pharaoh gives Joseph a ring 
to symbolize a deal has been made. Most ancient rings were made of 
steatite of medals such as bronze, silver or gold. Few were adorned with
 precious stones. Some of the oldest known rings were used as signets by
 rulers, public officials and traders to authorize documents with a 
stamp. Signatures were not used until late in history.

</p><p class="mark">  Kissing the feet, hands of hems of garments of 
important people was an expression of respect in ancient Egypt, Greece 
and Rome.

  Marriage was regarded as alliance between families, a joining of clans
 and union of property. Couples became married when they decided to live
 together. There was nor civil or religious ceremony. Prenuptial 
agreements were routinely signed to protect property.

</p><p class="mark">  Some scholars believe that the wedding ring dates 
back to ancient Egypt. The finger ring was first used by the Egyptians 
around 2800 B.C. Some scholars believed that it may have symbolized 
marriage since the Egyptians viewed married as something that lasted an 
eternity and a circle or ring had no end. Rings of gold were prized by 
Egyptian nobility.

</p><p class="mark">  Egyptian exchanged sandals when they exchanged 
property or authority. A sandal was given to a groom by the father of 
the bride.

</p><p class="mark">  Some believe the word "honeymoon" comes from the 
ancient Egyptian custom of kidnaping the bride and holding her captive a
 moon (a month) and drinking a honey-sweetened drink during that time.

  Among pharaohs and their queens, brothers and sisters and even fathers
 and daughters intermarried. Incest was a way of keeping property in the
 family because women could inherent property. Scholars debate whether 
these marriages were consummated or simply ceremonial.

</p><p class="mark">  Describing the implications of a father-daughter marriage, Reay Tannahill wrote in <em>  Sex in History </em>
 : "A resulting son would be a half brother of his mother, his 
grandmother's stepson, his mother's brothers half brother, and not only 
his father's child but his grandson as well! Note the problems of 
identity and exercise of authority: should he act toward his mother as a
 son or as a half-brother; should the uncle be related as an uncle or as
 a half-brother”...if a brother and sister were to marry then divorce, 
could  they readily revert to their original relationship?"

</p><p>  Divorce simply involved moving out, after which they were allowed to remarry

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-10"><strong> Royal Incest</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark">  The ancient Egyptians were not the only royalty
 to have close relations among its close relations. David Dobbs wrote in
 National Geographic, “When New England missionary Hiram Bingham arrived
 in Hawaii in 1820, he was dismayed to find the natives indulging in 
idolatry, hula dancing, and, among the ruling family, incest. The 
Hawaiians themselves did not share Bingham's shock at the royals' 
behavior. Royal incest, notes historian Joanne Carando, was "not only 
accepted but even encouraged" in Hawaii as an exclusive royal privilege.
 [Source: David Dobbs, National Geographic, September 2010]

</p><p class="mark">  In fact, while virtually every culture in recorded
 history has held sibling or parent-child couplings taboo, royalty have 
been exempted in many societies, including ancient Egypt, Inca Peru, 
and, at times, Central Africa, Mexico, and Thailand. And while royal 
families in Europe avoided sibling incest, many, including the 
Hohenzollerns of Prussia, the Bourbons of France, and the British royal 
family, often married cousins. The Spanish Habsburgs, who ruled for 
nearly 200 years, frequently married among close relatives. Their 
dynasty ended in 1700 with the death of Charles II, a king so riddled 
with health and development problems that he didn't talk until he was 
four or walk until he was eight. He also had trouble chewing food and 
couldn't sire a child.

  The physical problems faced by Charles and the pharaoh Tutankhamun, 
the son of siblings, point to one possible explanation for the 
near-universal incest taboo: Overlapping genes can backfire. Siblings 
share half their genes on average, as do parents and offspring. First 
cousins' genomes overlap 12.5 percent. Matings between close relatives 
can raise the danger that harmful recessive genes, especially if 
combined repeatedly through generations, will match up in the offspring,
 leading to elevated chances of health or developmental 
problems---perhaps Tut's partially cleft palate and congenitally 
deformed foot or Charles's small stature and impotence.

</p><p class="mark">  If the royals knew of these potential downsides, 
they chose to ignore them. According to Stanford University classics 
professor Walter Scheidel, one reason is that "incest sets them apart." 
Royal incest occurs mainly in societies where rulers have tremendous 
power and no peers, except the gods. Since gods marry each other, so 
should royals. Incest also protects royal assets. Marrying family 
members ensures that a king will share riches, privilege, and power only
 with people already his relatives. In dominant, centralized societies 
such as ancient Egypt or Inca Peru, this can mean limiting the mating 
circle to immediate family. In societies with overlapping cultures, as 
in second-millennium Europe, it can mean marrying extended family 
members from other regimes to forge alliances while keeping power among 
kin.

</p><p class="mark">  And the hazards, while real, are not absolute. 
Even the high rates of genetic overlap generated in the offspring of 
sibling unions, for instance, can create more healthy children than sick
 ones. And royal wealth can help offset some medical conditions; Charles
 II lived far better (and probably longer, dying at age 38) than he 
would have were he a peasant.

</p><p class="mark">  A king or a pharaoh can also hedge the risk of his
 incestuous bets by placing wagers elsewhere. He can mate, as Stanford 
classicist Josiah Ober notes, "with pretty much anybody he wants to." 
Inca ruler Huayna Capac (1493-1527), for instance, passed power not only
 to his son Huáscar, whose mother was Capac's wife and sister, but also 
to his son Atahualpa, whose mother was apparently a consort. And King 
Rama V of Thailand (1873-1910) sired more than 70 children---some from 
marriages to half sisters but most with dozens of consorts and 
concubines. Such a ruler could opt to funnel wealth, security, 
education, and even political power to many of his children, regardless 
of the status of the mother. A geneticist would say he was offering his 
genes many paths to the future.

</p><p class="mark">  It can all seem rather mercenary. Yet affection 
sometimes drives these bonds. Bingham learned that even after King 
Kamehameha III of Hawaii accepted Christian rule, he slept for several 
years with his sister, Princess Nahi'ena'ena---pleasing their elders but
 disturbing the missionaries. They did it, says historian Carando, 
because they loved each other.

</p><p><strong></strong></p><h3 id="chapter-11"><strong> King Tutankhamuns and Royal Incest</strong></h3>

<p></p><p class="mark"> <span class="right"><img src="ANCIENT-EGYPTIAN-PEOPLE-FESTIVALS-AND-MARRIAGE%20_%20Facts-and-Details_files/20120215-Tutankhamun%2520cairo%2520museum.jpg" hight="299" alt="20120215-Tutankhamun cairo museum.jpg" title="20120215-Tutankhamun cairo museum.jpg" width="316"><br> Tutankhamun </span>
  All of these maladies are thought to have been the result of 
inbreeding between his father and mother---his father’s sister. Zahi 
Hawass wrote in National Geographic, “In my view...Tutankhamun's health 
was compromised from the moment he was conceived. His mother and father 
were full brother and sister. Pharaonic Egypt was not the only society 
in history to institutionalize royal incest, which can have political 
advantages. (See "The Risks and Rewards of Royal Incest.") But there can
 be a dangerous consequence. Married siblings are more likely to pass on
 twin copies of harmful genes, leaving their children vulnerable to a 
variety of genetic defects. Tutankhamun's malformed foot may have been 
one such flaw. We suspect he also had a partially cleft palate, another 
congenital defect. Perhaps he struggled against others until a severe 
bout of malaria or a leg broken in an accident added one strain too many
 to a body that could no longer carry the load. [Source: Zahi Hawass, 
National Geographic, September 2010]

</p><p class="mark">  There may be one other poignant testimony to the 
legacy of royal incest buried with Tutankhamun in his tomb. While the 
data are still incomplete, our study suggests that one of the mummified 
fetuses found there is the daughter of Tutankhamun himself, and the 
other fetus is probably his child as well. So far we have been able to 
obtain only partial data for the two female mummies from KV21. One of 
them, KV21A, may well be the infants' mother and thus, Tutankhamun's 
wife, Ankhesenamun. We know from history that she was the daughter of 
Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and thus likely her husband's half sister. 
Another consequence of inbreeding can be children whose genetic defects 
do not allow them to be brought to term.

</p><p class="mark">  So perhaps this is where the play ends, at least 
for now: with a young king and his queen trying, but failing, to 
conceive a living heir for the throne of Egypt. Among the many splendid 
artifacts buried with Tutankhamun is a small ivory-paneled box, carved 
with a scene of the royal couple. Tutankhamun is leaning on his cane 
while his wife holds out to him a bunch of flowers. In this and other 
depictions, they appear serenely in love. The failure of that love to 
bear fruit ended not just a family but also a dynasty.

  The hieroglyphic for "love" consists of a hoe, a moth and a man with a
 hand in his mouth. It literally meant "to want, choose, or desire." 
Lovers in poems often address each other as brother or sister.

</p><p class="mark">  Archaeologists have found 55 anonymous love poems, dated around 1300 B.C., on papyri and vases. One of them goes:

<br><em> 		More lovely than all other womanhood.

<br>			 a good year.
<br>		Splendid in colors.

<p></p><p class="mark">   Women had relatively high status in ancient 
Egypt and had more rights that women in other ancient societies. Several
 women became pharaohs and built their elaborate tombs. "Women could own
 land, appear before courts as plaintiffs or defendants, serve as 
priestesses and engage in business dealings."  The fact that sculptures 
of couples  presented men and women of equal height was seen as an 
indication that women enjoyed status equal to that of men.

</p><p class="mark"> <span class="left"><img src="ANCIENT-EGYPTIAN-PEOPLE-FESTIVALS-AND-MARRIAGE%20_%20Facts-and-Details_files/20120215-nefertari%2520Ahmose%2520v.jpg" hight="252" alt="20120215-nefertari Ahmose v.jpg" title="20120215-nefertari Ahmose v.jpg" width="168"> <br> </span>
  Women were allowed to travel freely and often enjoyed the same 
pastimes as men. During important proceeding high raking women sometimes
 donned fake beards to show they commanded the same authority as men.

</p><p class="mark">  The first known book of manners and correct manners, The <em>  Instructions of Ptahhotep </em>
 , written around 2500 B.C. advises women to "Be silent it is a better 
gift than flowers.”  In 1850 B.C. women used a tampon-like device made 
from shredded linen and crushed and gum arabic (acacia branch powder).

</p><p class="mark">  Painting scenes show ancient Egyptian women 
carrying supplies and food on their head much as some modern Egyptian 
village women do today. Herodotus wrote how Egyptian women spent a great
 deal of time laboriously washing linen clothes.

</p><p class="mark">  Career options for women were limited. Holland 
Cotter wrote in the New York Times, “Women might find work as 
professional mourners -- one sees a cluster of them gesturing and 
wailing in a funerary carving -- or as performers in court and temple 
rituals. In a relief from the tomb of a Middle Kingdom queen, female 
musicians raise frondlike hands in the air as they clap out a rhythm.

</p><p class="mark">  Two exhibits of Egyptian art in New York in 
1997--- ''Queen Nefertiti and the Royal Women'' at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and ''Mistress of the House, Mistress of Heaven: Women in 
Ancient Egypt'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art---highlighted the place 
that women held in ancient Egypt.

</p><p class="mark">  Art critic Holland Cotter wrote in the New York 
Times that ''Women in Ancient Egypt'' did a particularly fine job giving
 viewers an idea of what it was like to be a woman in ancient Egypt. The
 exhibit he wrote “steers a smooth course between an outdated view of 
the Egyptian woman as a kind of dynastic fashion plate and a newer 
theoretical take that threatens to reduce her to a mere pawn in a 
patriarchal game. Instead, the more than 200 objects gathered 
here---many of them beautiful, some of them prosaic, a few simply 
bizarre---confirm the complexity of her identity: as both mistress and 
servant, mother and mother-goddess, marital commodity and property 
owner, and as an individual seeking fulfillment in this life and 
salvation in the next. [Source: Holland Cotter, New York Times, February
 21, 1997]

  The show...opens with an Old Kingdom limestone effigy of a man and a 
woman standing together. Their torsos are sensually modeled, their 
facial features regular but individualized, melding the ideal with the 
real. Their pose is unabashedly affectionate: her arm encircles his 
waist, his hand passes over her shoulder and touches her breast. But 
distinctions between the figures are marked. The man, in every way the 
dominant figure, is a full head taller than his mate. Where his face is 
upward-looking and warmed by a faint but self-confident smile, hers 
seems pensive. She gazes slightly downward and to the side, tensed, as 
if listening for something. What could it be? The cry of unruly 
children? The clatter of plates in a kitchen? The hum of weaving in a 
distant room? The pulse of life beating in the earth?

</p><p class="mark">  Much about the woman's status can be read here. 
Variations in the heights of figures are often a visual code for rank in
 the social hierarchy. While the man in this case is identified by name 
in an inscription, the woman is not. And contemporary documents suggest 
that if this pair were married (there is no clear proof that they are), 
the woman would have fewer legal rights than her husband.

</p><p class="mark">  In fact, ''Women in Ancient Egypt,'' organized by 
Glenn Markoe, Anne Capel and Richard Fazzini, does much to upset the 
long-held assumption that Egyptian society was exceptional among ancient
 cultures for its sexual parity. Recurrent images in the show of women 
breast-feeding children, picking fruit, grinding grain, carrying baskets
 and dressing one another's hair confirm that while men moved in a 
public sphere, women of all classes were traditionally restricted to the
 home.

  Cotter wrote in the New York Times that while the options of ordinary 
women were limited women of high rank could acquire material wealth in 
the form of real estate and luxury items. A wealth of jewelry survives 
from burials, and samples in the show range from necklaces of amethyst, 
gold and lapis lazuli to razor-thin silver torques, and from amulets in 
the form of shells or animals to effigies of protective goddesses. 
[Source: Holland Cotter, New York Times, February 21, 1997]

</p><p class="mark">  And a few individuals assumed the role of female 
pharaohs. The most famous of these was Hatshepsut, builder of a vast 
mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. In a large pink granite portrait 
statue in the show she wears the accouterments of a male king -- a false
 beard, a short kilt -- but an inscription refers to her as the daughter
 of the sun god.

</p><p class="mark">  Hatshepsut's unorthodox rise to power apparently 
caused few qualms among her subjects -- her reign from 1486 to 1468 B.C.
 was a time of marked prosperity for Egypt -- in part, perhaps, because 
female deities had long populated the Egyptian pantheon and were 
familiar presences in its art.

</p><p class="mark">  Some goddesses routinely took human form, as in 
the case of Maat, an embodiment of natural harmony, who is seen as a 
small bronze figure perched, with her knees drawn up, on an altar. 
Others were depicted as half-animal: Hathor had the head of a cow; 
Sekhmet, both revered and feared for her mercurial disposition, that of a
 lion. The popular Taweret was a one-person menagerie, with the head of a
 hippopotamus, the body of a crocodile, the paws of a lion, human 
breasts and a million-watt grin guaranteed to scare off ill-intentioned 
spirits.

</p><p class="mark">  These composite deities, in whom the fantastic and
 the everyday effortlessly merge, are among the unforgettable creations 
of world art. Yet the images in the show that linger longest in the mind
 are those that feel most intimately human.

</p><p class="mark">  It would be hard to find a vision more tender than
 that in the relief carving of Queen Nefertiti kissing her young 
daughter, their lips meeting as a disembodied celestial hand offers an 
ankh, the emblem of life. Nor is there anything in the Metropolitan's 
Nefertiti show to surpass the colossal head of a young queen, carved in 
dark gray-green chlorite, on view here. This breathtaking fragment, 
probably once attached to a sphinx's body, made its way to Italy in 
antiquity and was found at Hadrian's villa near Rome. The young woman's 
nose is missing, her chin chipped and repaired, but even in ruined 
condition her wide-eyed, candid visage, with its broad mouth and skin 
buffed to a soft sheen, palpitates with life.

  Wet nurses were often senior harem members. A drawing found in a 
chapel for King Tutankhamun showed a wet nurse with the young pharaoh. 
It bore the inscription: "royal nurse who suckled the boy of the god 
(pharaoh) and who was favored by the king."

their parents if they don’t want to, but daughters must whether they 
like it or not."

</p><p class="mark">  There is evidence that Egyptian children played 
marbles 5000 years ago ( rounded semiprecious stones buried with a child
 around 3000 B.C., in Nagada Egypt). Marbles and knucklebones from dogs 
and sheep were used by adults in divining rituals.  Rock, Scissors, 
Paper was played by the Egyptians and Romans. An Egyptian painting dated
 to 2000 B.C. shows a finger game like it being played.

</p><p class="mark">  Children in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome made 
hoops from dried and stripped grapevines and rolled them down the street
 with a rod.  Rattles made with dried gourds filled with clay balls or 
pebbles were discovered in children's tombs dated at 1360 B.C. They were
 shaped like birds, pigs and bears. Rattles were also used in ancient 
rituals to scare off evil spirits.  The earliest dolls were images and 
idols of gods. Playing with idols was considered sacrilegious so the 
first true dolls were model or ordinary people played with by children. 
Early females dolls had breasts and male dolls had penises.
