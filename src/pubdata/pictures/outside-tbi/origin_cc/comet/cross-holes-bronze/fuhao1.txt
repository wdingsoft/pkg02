			<strong>Fu-Hao And Si-Mu-Wu</strong></p>
		<p>

		<p>
			<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			Chinese archeologists and scholars usually use the scriptures discovered on site as primary hard evidences to identify the owner or the nature of its tomb -- even no soft evidences could be found. This methodology is not adquate for the tombs found in Anyang. Since its religion, beliefs and society were totally lost and they were possibly quite different to the rest of all perods in Chinese history. Typical examples are the so-called tombs of Fu-Hao and Si-Mu-Wu.</p>

			The so-called Tomb of Fu-Hao was discovered in 1976 at Yinxu of Anyang city. The excavation was officially conducted by the Anyang Working Team of the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It is the only original archaeological site at Anyan areas without any destruction or robery. Among 1928 different unearthed materials (https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/archae/2fuhmain.htm), there are 468 bronze objects, 209 of them contains inscriptions, 109 of them with inscriptons of &#39;Fu-Hao&#39;. Due this reason, the site was widely considered as the tomb for lady Fu-Hao -- a queen of King Wu Ding.</p>

			The critical point to interpret this picture</p>
		<p>
			Si-Mu-Wu is the largest and heviest bronze ware to survive from anywhere in Chinese history. The tetripod is 133 centimetres high, 110 centimetres wide, and 79 centimetres deep and weighs 832.84 kilograms(1,925 pounds). It is of the rectangular type, with a squared body and four legs. It was unearthed in Wuguan Village, Anyang, Henan in 1939.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The ding is originally named for the inscription in bronze ware script on the interior wall, which reads 司母戊&nbsp; , but since the 1970s archaeologists have agreed that the first character should be read as Hou 后 (meaning queen), whose mirror image looks like Si (司). The National Museum of China has officially corrected its name. 后母戊&nbsp; (H&ograve;umǔw&ugrave;), meaning &quot;Queen Mother Wu&quot;.[2] T司母戊鼎</p>
