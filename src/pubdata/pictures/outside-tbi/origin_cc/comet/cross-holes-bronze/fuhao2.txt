			<strong>Fu-Hao And Si-Mu-Wu</strong></p>
		<p>

		<p>
			<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
		<p>
			Chinese archeologists and scholars usually use the scriptures discovered on site as primary hard evidences to identify the owner or the nature of its tomb -- even no soft evidences could be found. This methodology is not adquate for the tombs found in Anyang. Since its religion, beliefs and society were totally lost and they were possibly quite different to the rest of all perods in Chinese history. Typical examples are the so-called tombs of Fu-Hao and Si-Mu-Wu.</p>

			<strong>Fu-Hao</strong></p>
		<p>
			The so-called Tomb of Fu-Hao was discovered in 1976 at Yinxu of Anyang city. The excavation was officially conducted by the Anyang Working Team of the Archaeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It is the only original archaeological site at Anyan areas without any destruction or robery. Among 1928 different unearthed materials (https://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/archae/2fuhmain.htm), there are 468 bronze objects, 209 of them contains inscriptions, 109 of them with inscriptons of &#39;Fu-Hao&#39;. Due this reason, the site was widely considered as the tomb for lady Fu-Hao -- a queen of King Wu Ding.</p>

			The critical issue to interpret this picture lie in the confusion of character of &#39;Fu&#39;. x pointed out that &#39;Fu&#39; is like a tree. ..... But such explaination still lack evidences to support.</p>
		<p>
			We noticed that the picture on this bronze encapsulated only three elements. Two of them were already literally known. More important, the &#39;son&#39; and &#39;woman&#39;&nbsp; consistent to the key figures described in Gospel account. If we continue to apply BE analysis, with visiual thinking method, we can quickly find the &#39;Fu&#39; could be related to the star mentioned in Mathew. Compared with the acient pictures about the comet, we can find that they was assemly to each other. TBI friends analysis show that &#39;Fu&#39; is related to &#39;son&#39;, &#39;rain&#39;, etc. These evidence could further support &#39;Fu&#39; is related to astronomy. &#39;Fu&#39; also looks like a feather in Hieroglyphics where it was considered as sacred symbol and usually put on the head.</p>
		<p>
			With GAP analysis, we know that the relationship between &#39;son&#39; and &#39;woman&#39; is not what we thought as in our daily life, with discovery of &#39;Fu&#39;, it further enhanced the specilties of such relationship -- what the whole picture on bronze intented to express was a forethcoming event same as what the Gospel articulated.</p>

			<strong>Si-Mu-Wu</strong></p>
		<p>
			Si-Mu-Wu is the largest and heaviest bronze ware ever discovered in Chinese history. The tetripod is 133 centimetres high, 110 centimetres wide, and 79 centimetres deep and weighs 832.84 kilograms(1,925 pounds). It is of the rectangular type, with a squared body and four legs. It was unearthed in Wuguan Village, Anyang, Henan in 1939.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The ding is originally named for the inscription in bronze ware script on the interior wall, which reads 司母戊, but since the 1970s archaeologists have agreed that the first character should be read as Hou 后 (meaning queen), whose mirror image looks like Si (司). In 2011, The National Museum of China has officially corrected its name. 后母戊&nbsp; (H&ograve;umǔw&ugrave;), meaning &quot;Queen Mother Wu&quot;.[2] T司母戊鼎. The quarrels between si and hou are still continues. No matter Si or Hou, Chinese scholars widely agree that the bonze is build for the Qeen, or step-mother of king. The tomb where the bonze was unearthed was considered as the tomb for the Queen, named Wu, or the step-monter of the King.</p>
